Welcome to the DigitalOcean Valkey 1-Click Application

Valkey is a high-performance data structure server that primarily serves key/value 
workloads. It supports a wide range of native structures and an extensible plugin 
system for adding new data structures and access patterns.ion.

All Valkey scripts and files may be found in /srv/valkey and the setup
utility can be run again by executing 'make install' in that directory.

To keep this Droplet secure, the UFW firewall is enabled.
All ports are BLOCKED except:
 - 22 (SSH)
 - 6379

A strong password has been set for your Valkey instance, and can be found in the file 
/root/.digitalocean_passwords

Valkey is bound to the droplet IP address and localhost.  To change this, edit the 
configuration here /srv/valkey/6379.conf

For help and more information, visit https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/valkey

Additional security recommendations can be found here: https://valkey.io/docs/management/security/acl.html
