-  Start by checking if the conda command is working. If not, run the following command:
  /home/anaconda/anaconda3/bin/conda init

  This command will set up the necessary configuration in the ~/.bashrc file. You may need to source ~/.bashrc or exit and run su - anaconda again.

- Jupyter Notebook is installed under the jupyter environment. You can manage the jupyter-notebook.service provided.

To check the status of the service, run the following:

sudo systemctl status jupyter-notebook

- If you want to run Jupyter Notebook instead of JupyterLab, you can manually enter the Jupyter virtual environment by running conda activate jupyter.
- The droplet already starts up an instance of the Jupyter Notebook on boot. If you need multiple instances, you'll have to run them up manually by providing port number to have different instances listening on different ports.

- Here's an example you can try out-of-the-box:
  cd ~/examples/stable_diffusion.openvino

  Remember to switch to the stable-diffusion-1.5 environment by executing 'conda activate stable-diffusion-1.5'.

- If you are new to Conda, you can refer to the Conda cheat sheet for a list of commands:
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf

- When running Jupyter Notebook in a separate environment (let's say venv1) from your actual application environment (let's say venv2), you need to add the venv2 kernel (path to Conda packages) to Jupyter Notebook. Run the following commands in venv2, and you will be able to see the venv2 kernel in Jupyter Notebook:

yes | pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name <venv2> --display-name "<venv2>"

- To inspect the source Packer files of this image, go to https://github.com/digitalocean/droplet-1-clicks and navigate to the jupyter-conda folder.

- The examples and virtual environments are taking 9GB of space. They are not taking up compute, unless you are running things. To clean up, it is just 3 command. Review the file 'Save-9GB-by-deleting-examples.txt'


Pure installation takes up the following space for the examples and virtual environments.

(openvino_notebooks) anaconda@jupyter-test:~$ du -sh examples/
463M    examples/
(openvino_notebooks) anaconda@jupyter-test:~$
(openvino_notebooks) anaconda@jupyter-test:~$ du -sh ~/.conda/envs/openvino_notebooks/
3.5G    /home/anaconda/.conda/envs/openvino_notebooks/
(openvino_notebooks) anaconda@jupyter-test:~$ du -sh ~/.conda/envs/stable-diffusion-1.5/5.3G    /home/anaconda/.conda/envs/stable-diffusion-1.5/

That is 9GB+. As you work through examples, models will be downloaded and cached (under ~/.cache), and that will quickly increase the space usage.

If you want to clean up the space and do not need the examples, just do the following.

Step 1:
\rm -rf ~/examples  # This will delete the entire example folder

Step 2:
(openvino_notebooks) anaconda@jupyter-test:~$ conda env list
# conda environments:
#
jupyter                  /home/anaconda/.conda/envs/jupyter
openvino_notebooks    *  /home/anaconda/.conda/envs/openvino_notebooks
stable-diffusion-1.5     /home/anaconda/.conda/envs/stable-diffusion-1.5
base                     /opt/conda

(openvino_notebooks) anaconda@jupyter-test:~$ conda env remove -y -n <env_name>

This should clean up the entire environment, saving you ~9GB.

Step 3:
Time to time, you can clean up the ~/.cache. Look for those unused models taking GBs of space.
